## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View an age in years, months, and days after submitting a valid date through the form
- Receive validation errors if:
  - Any field is empty when the form is submitted
  - The day number is not between 1-31
  - The month number is not between 1-12
  - The year is in the future
  - The date is invalid e.g. 31/04/1991 (there are 30 days in April)
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: See the age numbers animate to their final number when the form is submitted

## My process

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow
- Tailwind CSS
- TypeScript
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)



### What I learned

In this project, I have the opportunity to apply and enhance my understanding of TypeScript, allowing me to become more accustomed to its fundamental concept of typing. I am attempting to create a custom class using Tailwind CSS.

Additionally, I have the opportunity to reinforce my comprehension of state management in ReactJS through practical application.

Furthermore, I am also gaining a stronger grasp of handling and utilizing props effectively.


### Continued development

Certain aspects of responsiveness are not fully optimized at the moment. I am still in the process of determining the most suitable approach for creating animations when the results change. Additionally, I've encountered a challenge in altering the input border while it's in focus. 
Moving forward, my objective is to devise effective solutions for these issues and implement them successfully.
